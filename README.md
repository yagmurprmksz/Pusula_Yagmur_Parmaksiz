Data Science Case Study

This project aims to analyze and model drug side effects using a dataset containing information about patients' weight, height, gender, and other attributes. The analysis includes data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling to predict potential side effects based on various features.

To get started with this project, you'll need to set up your environment and install the necessary packages. Make sure you have the following installed:
Python (>=3.10)
JupyterLab
Required Python packages

Place the dataset file (side_effect_data.xlsx) in the project directory. Ensure that the path in your code matches the location of the file.

Running the Code:
Open JupyterLab
Navigate to the project directory
Open and run the Jupyter notebooks
